###Project
Abortion Data Visualization 2.0

###Conceptual Description
My project is about abortion access in the US. It first frames the issue with text that explains the modern landscape around abortion policy. It then allows the user to interact with a visualization that explains 10 restrictive policies that impact US states. Lastly, it allows the user to link out to an interactive map of US states and the policies that impact each of them. It provides several methods of sharing and visualizing related data to allow the user to understand the issue of abortion access in a number of ways. 

###Interaction Description
The piece should be set up on a screen that has a mouse or trackpad nearby for interaction. Users interact with the piece by hovering over the bubbles on the storyboard and the states on the interactive map to get more information. The intended audience would be people who would like to learn more about reproductive health policy. Those neutral or pro-abortion access would probably be most receptive to the presentation of the piece. The piece is aesthetically nice without the interaction, but most of the substantive information is accessed through interaction, amplifying the overall message with data.

###Extension
I took my original abortion data visualization piece and extended it to give more background to the user. I compiled the existing two pieces using ScrollMagic and placed before it background information on the current political landscape around abortion. I responded to the feedback of my peers about how theyâ€™d like to see the verbal background I shared when presenting in the actual piece. Instead of linking out to the map within the storyboard, I included a screenshot of the interactive map that links to the interactive version. I think streamlining more information into one scrollable window (that links out to the interactive map) tells a story and utilizes data more clearly and effectively. It makes it easier to understand if the user were alone or not receiving additional oral information.

###Technical Pieces
This piece uses ScrollMagic and p5.js. It is hosted on Github pages. Most of the code for the scrolling of the piece and content within is in HTML. The style is in CSS. The storyboard uses p5.js and the map uses leaflet.js. The data is accessed through JSON files.
